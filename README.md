# Cention Animated Banner

A high-performance, CSS-only animated hero banner designed for modern web applications. This project demonstrates advanced CSS techniques to create fluid, engaging user experiences without relying on heavy JavaScript libraries.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **CSS-Only Animations:** Utilizes `@keyframes` for smooth, hardware-accelerated transitions (60fps).
* **Asset Integration:** Implements `mix-blend-mode: screen` to seamlessly integrate the corporate logo into the dark theme without requiring transparency preprocessing.
* **Micro-Interactions:**
    * **"Wavy" Entrance:** A custom blur-and-slide animation for the logo reveal.
    * **Interactive Hover:** The logo floats continuously only when interacted with by the user.
    * **Liquid Button:** A "fill-up" animation state for the Call-to-Action button.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully fluid layout that adapts gracefully to mobile and tablet viewports.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup structure.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox, Absolute Positioning, CSS Variables, and Keyframe Animations.
